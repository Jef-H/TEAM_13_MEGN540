/**
 * Encoder.h/c defines the functions necessary to interface with the optical encoders on the Pololu Zumo 32U4 car.
 * For information regarding external interrupts please consult Section 11 of the atmega32U4 datasheet
 * https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7766-8-bit-AVR-ATmega16U4-32U4_Datasheet.pdf
 *
 * The Left encoder XOR for the Zumo Car is attached to Pin Change Interrupt 4 (pin PB4) (Section 11.1.5-11.1.7), the
 * channel A signal is connected to PE2. The Right encoder XOR is attached to External Interrupt 6 (pin PE6), the
 * channel A signal is connected to PF0. The full state can be recovered by remembering the channel A signal and XOR'ing
 * if it changes to define if the B signal side should be updated.

 * Timing.h/c defines a time interface using the atmel's 32U4 architecture.
 * For information on the timers please refer to the product documentation:

 * Section: 13. 8-bit Timer/Counter0 with PWM (Page 94) in the Atmel atmega32U4 datasheet.
 *
 * This will count time in 4us increments and provide an ISR at 1kHz using the A compare.  As
 * Timer 0 has two compare capabilities, the B can be used elsewhere, but note that this class
 * will be resetting it every time it reaches 249.
